Creating Customer Segments
--------------------------


This project is part of the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) program, from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xgqklu9t1c8ayaq/creating-customer-segments.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a> and the notebook with most of the codes used in this project <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ucaiado/Customer_Segments/blob/master/customer_segments.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>. I will use unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. The TEX file was produced with help of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hqymhncpkrsq).
